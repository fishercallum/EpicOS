A command-based chat bot for [Multiplayer Piano](https://multiplayerpiano.net), originally created in 2015.

## Extras

### 2017

#### [Epic's Chat Bot](https://github.com/cffisher/EpicOS/tree/main/extras/2017-epics-chat-bot)

- An alternate bot for Multiplayer Piano from 2017.

#### [Epic's Socket Bot](https://github.com/cffisher/EpicOS/tree/main/extras/2017-epics-socket-bot)

- A script from 2017 that splits [Ste-Art's MIDI player bot (NMPB)](https://nmpb-blog.blogspot.com/) into multiple bots to bypass Multiplayer Piano's note limit.

### 2018

#### [NMPB++](https://github.com/cffisher/EpicOS/tree/main/extras/2018-nmpb-plus-plus)

- A Node.js MIDI player from 2018, inspired by [Ste-Art's MIDI player bot (NMPB)](https://nmpb-blog.blogspot.com/).

### 2022

#### [Background Music](https://github.com/cffisher/background-music)

- A Node.js MIDI player created in November of 2022 that allowed users to opt-in to background music in their rooms.

### 2023

#### /talk

- A Node.js bot created in November of 2023 that made use of [Ollama](https://ollama.ai) & [GPT4All](https://gpt4all.io) to chat with users. Later converted into a HAL 9000 chat bot and fizzled out by the 27th of November, making way for a new version of EpicOS.

### 2024

#### [Requests](https://multiplayerpiano.net/?c=requests)

- A Node.js MIDI player bot that replaced EpicOS on the 10th of November 2024. Users can play, upload and stop MIDI files of their choice. It has a much better-defined scope than EpicOS, as reflected by its simple name.
